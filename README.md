Habibi is a bot for a personal Discord server. If you want to run your own Habibi, feel free!  You will need an .env file with the following secrets:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="<Bot Token>"
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID="<Application ID>"
```

Note - Application IDs aren't secret, but it's easier for me to put them together in one place.
